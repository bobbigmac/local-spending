      <h2>Understanding Economic Impact</h2>
      <p>When you spend £100, where does that money go next? The answer depends greatly on <em>where</em> you choose to spend it. Money spent locally circulates within your community multiple times, creating what economists call the "local multiplier effect."</p>
      <p>Research from the New Economics Foundation and other organizations has consistently shown that money spent at local businesses generates 2-3 times more economic benefit for local economies compared to spending at non-local businesses.</p>

          <h3>Local Multiplier Effect</h3>
          <p>The local multiplier effect refers to how many times money circulates within a local economy before leaving through non-local spending. Studies have shown that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For every £1 spent at a local business, up to £3 in additional economic value is created in the local community</li>
            <li>Independent, locally-owned businesses recirculate 2-3 times more revenue locally compared to absentee-owned businesses or national chains</li>
            <li>Local businesses typically spend more on local labor, services from local providers, and locally-sourced products</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="research-card">
          <h3>Community Benefits</h3>
          <p>Beyond direct economic impact, local spending provides numerous social and community benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Local businesses create approximately 60% of new jobs</li>
            <li>Areas with thriving local business districts have increased property values</li>
            <li>Local business owners donate more than twice as much per sales dollar to local nonprofits and community causes</li>
            <li>Diverse, unique local businesses create community character and maintain cultural distinctiveness</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="research-card">
          <h3>Environmental Benefits</h3>
          <p>Buying local also offers significant environmental advantages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduced transportation distances and associated carbon emissions</li>
            <li>Local food travels an average of 1,500 fewer miles than conventional food distribution</li>
            <li>Small, walkable business districts reduce dependency on cars</li>
            <li>Independent retailers often operate in town centers and existing buildings, contributing to less sprawl and habitat loss</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>About This Visualization</h2>
      <p>The retention rates used in this visualization are based on economic research studies of local multiplier effects. The numbers have been simplified to demonstrate the core concept:</p>
      
      <div class="methodology-details">
        <div class="method-item">
          <h4>Local Shops</h4>
          <p>Approximately 80% of money spent at locally-owned independent businesses remains in the local economy. Local business owners live locally, employ local people, use local professional services and suppliers, and are more likely to stock locally-produced goods.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="method-item">
          <h4>Amazon with UK Sellers</h4>
          <p>Around 40% of money spent at Amazon with UK-based sellers remains in the national economy. While this creates some UK jobs, profits largely go to Amazon's global operations, with substantially less local economic benefit compared to local shops.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="method-item">
          <h4>Amazon with Foreign Sellers</h4>
          <p>Only about 25% of money spent at Amazon with foreign sellers stays in the economy. With minimal local employment, overseas fulfillment centers, and global supply chains, most economic value leaves the country entirely.</p>

      <h2>Make Your Spending Count</h2>
      <p>Small changes in spending habits can have a significant impact on your local economy. Consider these actions:</p>
      <ul class="action-list">
        <li>Shift just 10% of your Amazon purchases to local businesses</li>
        <li>For every £100 spent, try to spend £20 at locally-owned retailers</li>
        <li>Find local alternatives for regular Amazon purchases</li>
        <li>Check if items on Amazon are available from UK sellers rather than international ones</li>
        <li>Recognize that sometimes a slightly higher price at a local shop creates significantly more local economic benefit</li>
      </ul>
